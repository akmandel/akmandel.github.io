The Tzedek Box is a new ritual supporting Jews and their allies in the ancient pursuit of a more just world.

We are the descendants of Abraham who [spoke truth to divine power][1], of Moses and Miriam who [stood up to tyranny][2] and [led the people to freedom][3], of the prophets who [insisted on righteousness][4], of generations of justice-seekers who [have demanded better from those in positions of authority][5].

The Tzedek Box aggregates news and opportunities about living out these values. It also serves as a journal after we engage in acts of justice, prompting us to reflect on what we've learned -- and what we still need to do. Each time we add our thoughts to our boxes, we are invited to recite a special blessing, creating space to name the Divine partnership necessary to repair our world. Finally, opening the box and reviewing its contents enable an annual “cheshbon tzedek,” a personal accounting of our justice work.

The Tzedek Box is private and self-reflective. In the spirit of Rambam’s ladder of tzedakah, the point is not self-congratulation or public recognition. However, you can form or join a tribe with peers -- recalling the 12 tribes of Israel, who each pooled their resources to contribute to the Greater Good. Here, you can share your actions with others, to activate the multiplying power of the Biblical verse “tzedek tzedek tirdof” (Deuteronomy 16:20): justice, justice you must pursue. 

Developed through a series of design workshops in both Jerusalem and New York, and pilot teams from North Dakota to New Zealand, this project is led by a group of rabbinical students from Hebrew Union College (New York, Cincinnati and Los Angeles) and Hebrew College in Boston, and supported by a diverse range of students, educators, non-profit professionals, lay leaders and clergy from multiple denominations and countries. Fifteen teams built physical Tzedek Boxes in the fall of 2019 and filled them with slips of paper reflecting on their acts of justice throughout the year. They then opened them in or around [Pesach Sheni][6] (a month after Passover), a holiday of biblical origins that gives people a second chance and an opportunity to serve the Greater Good.

We thank the Be Wise Fellowship at Hebrew Union College for supplying the grant to create this app. For our **Opportunities** section, we are currently aggregating actions from the partners of the [Jewish Social Justice Roundtable][7]. We hope that this introduction to these organizations inspires your deeper engagement with them. We aspire to showcase more local events over time.

We consider the contents of your box yours and private unless you choose to share them; we will only use tags from data that users apply to their entries in the aggregate in order to understand trends.

We love questions and suggestions! For general inquiries, write [contact@tzedekbox.org](mailto:contact@tzedekbox.org). For technical questions regarding the app, write [dev@tzedekbox.org](mailto:dev@tzedekbox.org).

We appreciate you downloading this app. It is powerful to pursue justice in our world together.

לא עליך המלאכה לגמור, ולא אתה בן חורין ליבטל ממנה.
*Lo alecha hamlacha ligmor v’lo atah ben chorin livatel mimenah.*

It is not incumbent upon you to complete the work, but nor are you free to desist from it. ([Pirkei Avot 2:16][8])
